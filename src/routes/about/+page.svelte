                    Few thoughts headed into our 12th Annual “Freedom” celebration. 
                    As you all know, this event has big meaning for the Cross fam, 
                    rooted in an early tradition set by my Dad’s Dad who served and 
                    loved our country. He and my Grandma celebrated our freedoms in 
                    true American style at their farm in northern VT.

                <p class="my-2 p-2">
                    Em and I not only sentimentally connect with the family roots of 
                    celebrating freedom, but as I have grown in my faith, also see this 
                    day taking on a deeper meaning - 
                    we embrace that we were all sinners, slaves to our sin. 
                    But because God’s great love for us, He sent His Son Jesus Christ to save us, 
                    to set us free. For it is freedom that Christ has set us free! 
                </p>
                <p class="my-2 p-2">
                    It is so important to Em and I that we maintain this vision for the day 
                    while keeping the event enjoyable for all. As the kids get older and the 
                    guest list expands there are some practical “guard rails” I want to more 
                    formally enforce together this year. Better said:

                    Oldie but a goodie. Unruly populous, shenanigans, shooting, swimming, slip and slide, speeches, sparklers etc.

                    Not a dry party. We give thanks to God for all He has made but we dont want to be a stumbling block for little eyes. 
                    The canoe will be filled with non alcoholic seltzers and water only this year. 
                    The beer, etc. will be in the unfinished garage/pantry. Some good stuff in there, enjoy!

                    Placing a hard rule that no kids have phones at this event. 
                    If any parent sees a kid on a phone, green light to address it immediately. 
                    I’d also prefer no adult posting of pictures on snapagram.

                <p class="m-3 p-2">
                    With the volume of kids, there will be designated swimming times when the ladder is open - 
                    we will be sure there is always an adult at the pool side during the set times. 
                    We will limit number of swimmers at once. Please have floaties for kids who cant touch. 
                    Also requesting modest bathing suits please.

                    5. Gun safety
                </h3>
                <p class="m-3 p-2">
                    We will be shooting with a bigger group this year at 9 AM. 
                    First 15 minutes will be reviewing gun safety rules. Dont worry about bringing ammo, 
                    I have plenty (we use a type that only carries so far and wont reach neighbors or those hanging at the house). 
                    On gun related note, feel free to have boys bring their toy guns for later in the day. 
                    Shoot is for age 18+ though any children a parent deems OK to watch the shoot, good with me (as long as said parent is present). 
                    I have extra ear protection for all.

                    Guidelines set so we can maintain heart and spirit of the event.
